I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at IIIT, Hyderabad. My broad interests are in applied math domains.

* In May, I began my research internship at [LAMSADE, Université Paris Dauphine - PSL](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/) under [Dr.Jérôme Lang](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~lang/) and [Dominik Peters](https://dominik-peters.de/). I am working at the intersection of computational social choice and ML, focusing on long-term fairness in the paradigm of [virtual democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R_wfUhLls0).
