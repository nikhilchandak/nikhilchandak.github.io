About
------
I'm a rising senior studying Computer Science at IIIT, Hyderabad. My broad interests are in decision-making, in diverse scenarios (sequential/under uncertainity/data-driven/etc).


Recent
------
* From Jan. 2024, I will be working with [Prof. Gillian Hadfield](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/gillian-k-hadfield/) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) in Toronto on how to make autonomous agents adaptive to social norms to incentivize cooperation.  
* From 21<sup>st</sup> June'22, I will be in Vienna, Austria, attending [SoCS'22](https://sites.google.com/unibs.it/socs2022/home?authuser=0) and [IJCAI'22](https://ijcai-22.org/).
* In May, I began my research internship at [LAMSADE, Université Paris Dauphine - PSL](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/) under [Dr. Jérôme Lang](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~lang/) and [Dominik Peters](https://dominik-peters.de/). I am working at the intersection of computational social choice and ML, focusing on long-term fairness in the paradigm of [virtual democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R_wfUhLls0).
