<!-- About
------
-->
I'm a final-year student majoring in Computer Science at IIIT, Hyderabad. My broad research interests are in *multi-agent systems*. I am currently working in the domain of empirical game-theoretical analysis and in the past, have worked on computational social choice and path planning in robotics. 


News
------
* From Jan. 2024, I will be working with [Prof. Gillian Hadfield](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/gillian-k-hadfield/) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) in Toronto on how to make autonomous agents adaptive to social norms to incentivize cooperative behavior.
* Our paper on [Proportional Aggregation of Preferences for Sequential Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14858) got accepted at AAAI'24! I will be in Vancouver, Canada in February  presenting our work. Hit me up if you would like to chat!

      In May 2022, I began my research internship at <a href="https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/">LAMSADE, Université Paris Dauphine - PSL</a> under <a href="https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~lang/">Dr. Jérôme Lang</a> and <a href="https://dominik-peters.de/">Dominik Peters</a>. I am working at the intersection of computational social choice and automated decision-making, focusing on long-term fairness in the paradigm of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R_wfUhLls0">virtual democracy</a>.
