<!-- About
------
-->

I'm a first-year ELLIS PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.mrtz.org/">Moritz Hardt</a>. My current research interests span alignment, emergent capabilities, and benchmarking of foundation models. In the past, I have worked on different research topics under the overarching domain of multi-agent systems.
