<!-- About
------
-->

I'm a ELLIS PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.mrtz.org/">Moritz Hardt</a>. My research is broadly in the domain of LLM post-training and AI evals. 

These days, I am most excited about:

<ul>
  <li>
    synthetic data (problem) generation pipelines for RL.
  </li>
  <li>
    pushing model's capabilities in hard exploration problems (where pass@k is ~0) via curriculum learning techniques. The end-goal here would be to approach scientific discovery problems like open math conjectures.
  </li>
  <li>
    agentic training of LLMs for long-horizon tasks with tool use. 
  </li>
</ul>

Past Work: My recent <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=91SrFSFNki&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Ameya%20Prabhu%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Ameya_Prabhu1)">project</a> has been on scaling data (synthetically) for training language models to become better at forecasting future events with RL. I also like working on meaningful evaluations and have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02856">pushed</a> for shifting the QA evals ecosystem from MCQ to more open-ended benchmarks.
